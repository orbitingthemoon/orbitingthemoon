### 🪻 About Me

I'm a **Product Designer** designing intuitive, accessible, and engaging experiences for products, 
apps, websites and games through strategy, storytelling, and problem-solving. 
My approach to design is inspired by everyday interactions, 
taking complex ideas and turning them into engaging, user-friendly solutions.
